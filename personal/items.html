                    Backup Magazine - Fully charge a teleporter without getting hit / It is advised to play a highly mobile character, 
                    such as Huntress or Mercenary, along with seeking as many movement items as you can. The “Tougher Times” item is 
                    also valuable, since it has a chance to negate damage.

                    Rusted Key - Defeat the teleporter boss under 15 seconds / The best strategy is to play as the Loader character, 
                    and have a thunder gauntlet fully charged and ready to rumble once the boss spawns. Once spawning, use grapple to 
                    build speed and let the gauntlet rip. This strategy will only work with high-damage items aboard. The best items for 
                    this would be Lens-Maker’s Glasses, Focus Crystal, Crowbar, Armor-Piercing Rounds, and either Kjaro’s or Runald’s Band.

                    Wax Quail - Reach 300% movespeed / Focus on items to increase speed such as Paul’s Goat Hoof, Energy Drink, 
                    and Red Whip. You can focus items by using scrappers and printers to obtain items in your favor.

                    Kjaro’s / Runald’s Band - Discover the hidden chamber in the Abandoned Aqueduct / On the map “Abandoned Aqueduct”, 
                    you can either bring along a friend or play as the Engineer. You can find 2 pressure plates randomly placed on 
                    the map. All of the spots are near rocks, so look around those. Have both pressed at once, via a friend or one 
                    of your Engineer Sentries. After which, the large barred door will open and you can enter. Defeat both enemies 
                    inside for the items. They’re tricky enemies, so bring plenty firepower!

                    Unstable Tesla Coil - Deal 5000 damage in one shot / This is easily obtained in the late game, but can be tricky 
                    without looping back to the first stage. Loader is your best bet, so pick her and focus on high-damage items. 
                    Let a thunder gauntlet rip once you feel beefed up enough. Loop back to the first stage to keep scaling yourself 
                    and getting stronger, making this one easier.

                <p>
                    Blast Shower - Die three times while burning / This sounds easy, but is difficult in reality. I advise using 
                    the “Artifact of Honor” artifact to turn all enemies to elites. This will increase the chance of an enemy being 
                    a burning elite, one that can easily light you aflame. Dying to their strikes doesn’t count, nor does their 
                    burning radius. You need to have the burning debuff applied to you and die to that. Try to find a Flaming Beetle 
                    Elite, and mow your own health down by cooking yourself on their burning radius. Once you feel healthy enough to 
                    survive a hit but low enough to die shortly after, get hit on purpose and get the burning debuff. Run away from 
                    the elite and hope you die to fire. Repeat this twice.

                    Hellfire Tincture - Kill 15 enemies simultaneously / Play as a character with a large area of effect attack, 
                    such as Artificer. The “Artifact of Swarm” makes this substantially easier, since it doubles enemies and halves 
                    their health. Focus on damage items so the same attack will be able to kill many. Gather as many low-health 
                    weak enemies together as you can and unleash the strongest blow you got!
