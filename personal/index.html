        <p>Risk of Rain 2 (ROR2 for short) progression is rather simple. Upon selecting your difficulty and character, you'll drop right
            into the action on Stage 1. It is highly advised to read up on your character abilities before jumping into the action, just
            so you can get a general idea of who you are working with.</p>

            <h2>Monsters</h2>
            <div class="content">

                <p>
                    Various monsters will sprout out of the ground left and right. Killing these monsters rewards you with
                    coins, which you use on the many chests and shrines scattered about the map you are on.

            <h2>Chests and Items</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <img src="images/ror2_chest.png" alt="Chest Image" />
                <p>
                    Use this money on the goods and they'll grant you a random item which will greatly help you on your
                    journey. These items grant benefits such as increased mobility, damage, area of effect attacksâ€”the list
                    keeps going! Beating ROR2 without items is hopeless, so grab as many as you can!

                <p>
                    Be swift, however... You're on a timer! If you point your gaze towards the top-right corner, you'll spot
                    the difficulty you selected previously as well as a bar beneath it. This bar will gradually go up to
                    harder difficulties, making the game harder the longer you play. Be sure to grab plenty items, but not
                    waste time doing so!

            <h2>Boss Teleporter</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <img src="images/ror2_teleporter.jpg" alt="Boss Event Image" />
                <p>
                    Once you feel ready, find the teleporter on the map and activate it. This will summon a boss for you to
                    conquer. Should you succeed, you will be rewarded with a rare item. Finish charging the teleporter to
                    100% by staying in its red radius and you'll be able to proceed to Stage 2...
                    Rinse and repeat this process until you reach Stage 6, the final boss. Charge the 4 pillars, go to the
                    arena, and fight for your life. Should you emerge victorious, make a mad dash for the entrance of the
                    stage and charge the dropship before leaving.
